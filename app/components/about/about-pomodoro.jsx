		<h1>What Is The Pomodoro Technique?</h1>
		<p>The idea behind the Pomodoro Technique is to break down all of your tasks into 25 minute time blocks. Between
			each time block, there is a five minute break. And after completing four Pomodoros you take a longer
			breakâ€”usually 15 to 30 minutes. In order to accomplish your Pomodoro it's best to ignore all distractions
			and just focus on your task at
			hand. Use your breaks to check twitter or respond to emails or text messages.
		</p>
		<h1>Pomodoro Technique in 5 Steps:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose the task(s) you would like to get done</li>
			<li>Perform that task for 25 minutes (Pomodoro)</li>
			<li>Keep doing that task until the timer is up</li>
			<li>Take a 5 minute break</li>
			<li>After 4 Pomodoros take a 25 minute break</li>
		</ol>
		<h1>Benefits</h1>
		<p>If you start tracking how long it takes to finish tasks, then you can start tracking how many pomodoros it
			takes to finish a task.
			Mixing pomodoros with other development practices may help with task estimation.</p>
		<p>One of the biggest benefits is the cut down on interruptions and distractions. This will help you focus on
			your task and be able to finish everything that you had planned to finish. This will also help motivate you
			to push to finish a task within a pomodoro.</p>
		<p>Last but not least, it's extremely important to always take your breaks. This not only lets you resolve
			interruptions but it helps refresh your brain while taking a step back.</p>
